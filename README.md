# Open Ed Oz
This is a repo of the website developed for the OpenEdOz, an Office for Learning and Teaching project. 

The OpenEdOz project began in 2014 and was completed in 2016.

The project worked to:

- Focus on the missing voice of students in understanding emerging technology-based open educational practices (OEP)
- Determine how student learning outcomes can be enhanced with open education practices;
- Develop case studies that captures University Practice;
- Develop a National Roadmap for an Australian Open Education Strategy, fostering relevant uptake of open educational resources (OER) and open courses.
